Autonomous and teleoperated programs for the 2020-2021 Ultimate Goal FTC Challenge for team 10553
# Robot
Our robot is built using 8 40:1 Rev HD Hex motors and 6 Rev Smart Robot Servos. The wheels have the GoBilda mechanum wheels 
# Teleop
Our teleop currently uses the left joystick for basic wheel movements, the right joystick for strafing, A and B for intaking and spitting out respecitvely on gamepad 1. Gamepad 2 uses the left joystick for moving the bulldozer, A and B for scooping or lifting respectively, and X for shooting.
# Autonomous
We currently only have autonomous for the blue side. We are using vuforia and tensorflow for ring detection while using encoders for movements. We currently only have movement and detection. Soon, we will implement dropping the wobble goal and shooting.
